# About Swell

  Swell started with the idea of "Spend well" to prevent unnecessary spending.
  Most of people use ledger to keep track of their expenditures. 
  The problem is they already spent on something even if it might not be necessary. 
  That is why I wanted to prevent impulsing buying before they spend by setting priorities.

  Swell is a budget planner with priority of items and simple design to catch eyes. 
  App Swell lets you save money by giving information about the most or least priority you need to spend. 
  These features help to think your spending habit by keeping track of expenditure. 
  Total on the main screen shows the total amount of all the items automatically when you add item.
