# About Swell

Swell started with the idea of "Spend well" to prevent unnecessary spending.<br>
Most of people use ledger to keep track of their expenditures. <br>
The problem is they already spent on something even if it might not be necessary. <br>
That is why I wanted to prevent impulsion buying before they spend by setting priorities.<br>

Swell is a budget planner with priority of items and simple design to catch eyes. <br>
App Swell lets you save money by giving information about the most or least priority you need to spend. <br>
These features help to think your spending habit by keeping track of expenditure. <br>
Total on the main screen shows the total amount of all the items automatically when you add item. <br>

I hope users can minimize unnecessary items by seeing the total amount displayed on the main screen. <br>
(Currency symbol will be automatically changed depending on where you live.)<br>
